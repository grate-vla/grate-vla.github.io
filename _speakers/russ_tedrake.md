<p><b> Speaker Bio </b></p>

Professor Tedrake is the Toyota Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Aeronautics and Astronautics, and Mechanical Engineering at MIT, the Director of the Center for Robotics at the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab, and the leader of Team MIT's entry in the DARPA Robotics Challenge. Russ is also the Senior Vice President of Robotics Research at the Toyota Research Institute. He is interested in finding elegant control solutions for interesting (underactuated, stochastic, and/or difficult to model) dynamical systems. He is particularly interested in finding connections between mechanics (especially non-smooth mechanics) and optimization theory which enable formal analysis and control design for complex mechanical systems. These days he is primarily interested in bringing the rigor of systems theory to robot manipulation.
