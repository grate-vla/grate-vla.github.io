The challenge will feature five keynote addresses by leading researchers
on target data collection for efficient fine-tuning of VLAs, grounding VLAs with world models,
enforcing safety in VLAs, and designing VLA policies for robustness. Moreover, the workshop will
feature a panel discussion on the crucial question: “Is data scaling the key to robust, generalizable
VLA policies?,” where participants will get the opportunity to ask the panelists research-provoking
questions. We hope these discussion spark useful research collaborations. Lastly, the challenge
invites researchers to submit papers on their research related to aforementioned research themes of
this challenge. The challenge will include poster sessions for accepted paper submissions, particularly
focused on early-stage/on-going research to further provide an opportunity for presenters to share their
work and receive feedback. The authors of the best paper submissions will be given an opportunity
for an oral presentation of their work.

This challenge invites all robot manipulation researchers to submit their
contributions on generalist robot manipulation policies that generalize to the real-world. The challenge
is designed to be accessible to all researchers, regardless of the researcher’s access to research
resources, by allowing for the use of open-source training data, and open-source pretrained policies
for bootstrapping their submissions. In particular, we encourage submissions that:
1. Provide simple interfaces for policy deployment with interpretable action proposals and
performance predictions,
2. Utilize open-source datasets and foundation models for training generalist robot manipulation policies,
3. Leverage predictive redteaming for target data collection and fine-tuning,
4. Harness open-source world models for efficient data scaling and grouding, especially
centered on failure scenarios.
